## Best practices
For this project I did not focused on best practices in terms of styling and code organizations, modularization and runtime/space complexity

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install nodeJS version 12.18.3 and NPM (installing node, npm will be automatically installed too)

```
https://nodejs.org/en/

```

If you have node js installed, the next step is installing the Angular CLI itself to your computer. 
Run in the console the below command line (global and locally):

```
`npm install -g @angular/cli@9.0.0`

```

Install Angular dev dependencies
```
`npm install @angular/animations@9.0.0 @angular/common@9.0.0 @angular/compiler@9.0.0 @angular/core@9.0.0 @angular/forms@9.0.0 @angular/platform-browser@9.0.0 @angular/platform-browser-dynamic@9.0.0 @angular/platform-server@9.0.0 @angular/router@9.0.0`

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the url repository in your local where considered by running git clone.

```
`git clone "<url>"`
```

Open a terminal in the root directory of the project and install all the dependencies (node_modules folder will
be generated) via npm as follows:

```
`npm install`
```

Open other terminal in the root directory of the project and run the below command line to run the project and the local server.

```
`ng serve -o`
```

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Running the tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

A karma browser will be displayed with the result and report.
